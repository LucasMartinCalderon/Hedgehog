## Introduction
Hedgehog is a revolutionary DeFi protocol designed to hedge against impermanent loss for liquidity providers. The protocol creates an NFT derivative representing the upper and lower bound of the concentrated liquidity on Uniswap. By establishing an expiry date and determining the premium via a Monte-Carlo function, Hedgehog mitigates the risks associated with impermanent loss. Hedgehog serves two types of users: LPs seeking to hedge against impermanent loss through derivatives, and Hedgehog token holders looking to earn capital gains as the token value increases.
