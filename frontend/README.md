# Valahd

Valahd is an open-source platform designed for secure and privacy-focused market portfolio analysis. The name 'Valahd' comes from the Dothraki language in the popular series Game of Thrones, where it means 'giddy up.' It was famously used by Daenerys in season 5 when commanding her dragon, Drogon, to fly while she was surrounded by the Sons of the Harpy. Just as Daenerys took control in her moment of need, Valahd aims to give its users control over their investment data.

The color theme of Valahd is inspired by the vibrant hues of the unicorn emoji. This symbol of magic and wonder encapsulates the vision of Valahd - to create a tool that feels both exciting and intuitive, turning the often complex world of investment portfolio analysis into a delightful and empowering experience. With its playful yet sophisticated design, Valahd invites users to explore their data in a new light, offering a unique blend of functionality and aesthetics.

Funded by Amanda from Top-Value, Valahd operates locally on your machine, providing user control over data and privacy. It offers a range of and datas for all investment levels, and its open-source nature encourages community contributions. Amanda's generous funding has been pivotal in bringing this tool to the public.
